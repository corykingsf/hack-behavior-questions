*  Why do you want to work here. 
*  These are the behavioral interview questions and they can seem scary because they're so vague and open. But after this section, you'll be a pro. After we talk through some common frameworks. Some ways to prepare, and most importantly, how to be authentic. The key to answering the behavioral interview is authenticity, be genuine, be yourself, and most else will follow. Truly if your passion to work at the company or if you're excited to learn more about it. These things will naturally come up in your interview. So, if there's one thing that I want you to take from this video is really just relax, authenticity, being relaxed and being yourself is truly the best way to prepare. Now, I understand that being yourself isn't great advice to someone who's stressed out for an upcoming behavioral interview. So, if I had to recommend one other thing, it would be to practice. The more you practice, the lower your nerves will be and the more effective, that you will be in the interview. So definitely make sure to get that practice and to beat out on the tech stuff, but we're going to be focusing in this section on some questions that will be very helpful for you to prepare for when you're going through that behavioral interview.
